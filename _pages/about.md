The Junior IO Scholars Workshop is a virtual, interdisciplinary, graduate-student-run workshop where graduate students, pre- and post-docs, and junior faculty can present and solicit feedback on their work. This workshop will be an opportunity to receive substantive feedback from peers and leaders in the field, and to develop a community of scholars with shared research interests.

We invite people working on international organizations, broadly defined, inclusive of international law, foreign policy, and related areas, to participate and/or sign up to our mailing list. Additionally, we encourage participation across different types of research, including theoretical, interdisciplinary, empirical, and policy oriented work.

Job Market Talks: 35-40 minutes presentation, 45 minutes Q&A.

Regular Talks: 15-20 minutes presentation, 40 minutes Q&A.

Sessions will be recorded and are available to the presenter upon request.


*The workshop is committed to promoting the work and voices of Black, Indigenous, POC, and women scholars.*

The Junior IO Scholars Workshop is a virtual, interdisciplinary, graduate-student-run workshop where graduate students, pre- and post-docs, and junior faculty can present and solicit feedback on their work. This workshop will be an opportunity to receive substantive feedback from peers and leaders in the field, and to develop a community of scholars with shared research interests.

We are seeking submissions from people interested in presenting their work or discussing others’ works this fall, as well as non-presenting participants at any stage in their careers. We welcome longer-form practice job talk presentations (~45 minutes) as well as shorter presentations of works in progress (~20 minutes). Presentations will be followed by time for Q&A. Participants are expected to read the papers before the workshop. The tentative dates for the fall semester presentations are 9/6, 9/20, 10/4, 10/18, 11/1, 11/15, 11/29, and 12/13 at 4:00pm Eastern.

We encourage submissions from people working on work related to international organizations, broadly defined, inclusive of international law, foreign policy, and related areas. We also welcome different types of research, including theoretical, interdisciplinary, empirical, and policy oriented works, as well as pre-analysis plans and research designs.
